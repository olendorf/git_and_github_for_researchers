  Git allows us to create copies of our work called branches. These branches can be developed
  independently, merged back into our main branch or pruned if need be. Branches have many uses.
  They are often used in collaborative projects to allow collabortors to work independently then 
  merge their work. Branches can also be distinct releases of a product, say editions of a book or 
  variations of a manuscript. While relatively simple, entire PhD theses have been written on 
  workflows based on Git branches and their relationship with GitHub and other related services.
